# Weather-Viz

**Our Product**
Let’s start with the problem. In today’s world, the primary way to access information about the weather over the next couple of days is to stare at a bunch of numbers on a site like Weather.com. You’re given a bunch of numbers corresponding to things like dew point, wind speed, UV index, and AQI that you’re not sure how to make sense of.

**Weather-Viz provides a way to experience and to truly understand weather forecasts.** It’s a VR application that simulates the weather conditions at a given time and day in a virtual environment that acts as a “digital twin” of the user’s inputted location.
Users of our application are given the ability to visualize weather conditions that they’d see a few days in the future: for example, how the rain will look, how the wind speed will affect their surroundings, and how bright it’ll be. But for the first time, they’re given a glimpse at things that they may not be able to visualize in real-time: for instance, the amount of harmful pollutants in the air and the UV index. 

**Our Team**
**Varoon Kodithala** (IE ‘26) and **Joey Hassett** (CS ‘26) were responsible for developing the C# script that converted an address into 16-day weather forecasts for that location. They also developed the UI for Weather-Viz. **Anthony Stroffolino** (Business ‘26) was responsible for creating the dynamic virtual environment that users are inputted in when they first load our application. **Sathvik Vangavolu** (Comp E. ‘26) was responsible for the creation and implementation of a technique that uses photogrammetry and computer vision to convert an address into an automatically rendered 3D “digital twin”.

The Weather-Viz team came into this project with ZERO experience in VR development, Unity, and C# scripting. We are all freshmen at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and none of us had ever put on a VR headset or participated in a hackathon.
